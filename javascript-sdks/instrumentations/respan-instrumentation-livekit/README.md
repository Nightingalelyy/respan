# @respan/instrumentation-livekit

Translate the LiveKit Agents TypeScript SDK's native OpenTelemetry spans through
Respan's tracing runtime. Tested with `@livekit/agents` 1.4.0 and 1.9.2; requires
`@respan/tracing` 1.6.1 or newer.

```ts
import { Respan } from "@respan/respan";
import { LiveKitInstrumentor } from "@respan/instrumentation-livekit";

const respan = new Respan({
  apiKey: process.env.RESPAN_API_KEY,
  instrumentations: [new LiveKitInstrumentor()],
});
await respan.initialize();
// Start your normal LiveKit AgentSession after initialization.
```

The adapter uses LiveKit's public dynamic tracer and the active Respan provider.
It preserves native session, tool, promise, stream, chunk, and error behavior.
`activate()` calls coalesce; `deactivate()` releases the registration while
already-started spans finish through their original transformer lease.
`isActive()` reports the registration state.

Session, agent/user turn, LLM, tool, and TTS spans map to canonical Respan fields.
Both the older `lk.*` fields and current `lk.pii.*`/GenAI message fields are
supported. Logical LLM nodes receive their native request's usage and content;
correlated transport wrappers are omitted in semantic naming mode, while retry
attempts remain visible. Standalone native LLM requests remain chats. Translation
and raw-key removal happen on an export copy, preserving the original vendor
span's attributes for other processors.

Tool executions contain `{name, arguments}` input and the actual result, with
`gen_ai.tool.call.id` when LiveKit emitted one. Tool definitions, history, and
structured/multimodal content are preserved without translator length limits.
Provider request IDs and native timing measurements merge into the canonical
`respan.metadata` JSON object. Usage comes from native emitted values.

```ts
const instrumentor = new LiveKitInstrumentor({
  traceContent: false, // omit content from every supported native span
  // recordInputs: false,  // independently disable the input lane
  // recordOutputs: false, // independently disable the output lane
});
```

`RESPAN_TRACE_CONTENT=false`, `TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=false`, Traceloop's canonical
content context, tracing suppression, and observed ancestor/span
`allow_trace_content=false` also impose capture ceilings. A later `true` cannot
restore denied content on an admitted span. The adapter runs after the real
OpenTelemetry sampler and guards native recording/readable span attributes,
events, and status against late content writes. DROP and RECORD_ONLY spans do
not enter adapter payload translation.

LiveKit's own telemetry has version-specific limits:

- Its LLM node serializes its own chat context even when the sampler drops the
  span. The adapter prevents its own copying and recording after denial; it does
  not change LiveKit's internal serialization.
- Native tool-definition telemetry provides names on 1.4.0 and names/descriptions
  on 1.9.2. Parameter schemas reach the provider but are absent from those native
  telemetry records. Minimum-version execution spans also omit call IDs.
- Native chat-context serialization omits image/audio bodies by default. Current
  GenAI request telemetry can retain image URI/audio descriptors; omitted native
  bytes are not reconstructed. Direct TTS request spans expose model/metrics but
  do not expose the input text or audio bytes.
- LiveKit 1.4.0 emits an unhandled rejection after a provider failure from its
  background task. A bare-SDK comparison confirms the same behavior with this
  adapter. The adapter preserves it and does not synthesize a completion.

The paired examples use genuine `AgentSession`, function tools, handoffs, and the
official OpenAI provider plugin with controlled fetch/SSE/PCM transport. No
LiveKit room or paid provider call is required.
